# MASNUM-wave-model
The third-generation Wave Model LAGFD-WAM was proposed early in 1990s in LAGFD (Laboratory of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics), FIO (First Institute of Oceanography) of SOA (State Oceanic Administration), China. It has marked originality in 1) The energy and action energy spectrum balance equations, 2) The source functions of dissipation and bottom friction, 3) The wave-current interaction source function and 4) The computational scheme. The model has been compared with WAM model in typical wind fields and gave concerted results in general sea state and good improvement in high sea state. Also the model has been used in China seas for forecast and hindcast practices and got results consistent with filed measured data.
